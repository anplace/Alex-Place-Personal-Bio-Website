# Personal-Bio-Website
A website to recreate the project 2 website but edited to have our personal bio information as opposed to the placeholder information

### Purpose 
The purpose of this work is to create a website that future employers, and current employers for the purpose of promotion, look at to consider me for a position. The website so far, is extremely basic but for the sake of keeping up with the class workload, I have decided to submit it as is and come back in a week or two after some extensive practice and modify the contents to truly show my capabilities. 

### Request From User
- Create a website that looks nearly identical to the given website (screenshot is below).
- Use flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables to match the example.
- Produce a responsive website.
- Present my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me.
- How to contact me.
- When hovering over an application's image the image should be larger in size than the others.
- The application's image is a link to the deployed site.
- When the site is resized the page will present what the site looks like on various screens and devices.
